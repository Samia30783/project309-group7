	<div>Restorative Yoga. Restorative yoga is suitable for beginners and practitioners of all levels. By definition, restorative yoga is a restful practice that holds yoga poses (asanas) for a longer duration using props like yoga blocks, blankets, and bolsters. It is a practice of deep relaxation that emphasizes the meditative aspect of yogaâ€”the union of body and mind. Through the use of props for support, the postures are held almost effortlessly.<br>When the body enters a state of relaxation the mind can also consciously relax as tension is released from both body and mind. The only work that's required on your part during a restorative yoga practice is to pay attention to your breath and become aware of any sensations or thoughts that may arise.</div>
